# TODO/Questions: #

1. Check the comments in the report.tex file.
2. Have a look on the report: check if styling is ok etc.
3. Could you fill the SVG section with the exact topics covered please? Also if you have some ideas for the depth and dynamic pages ones or if you spot anything I missed feel free to add to these.
4. There was one more thing regarding XHTML delivery: At the moment, we only send pages with content type text/html; shall I add the application/xhtml+xml approach he discussed in the slides as well?
